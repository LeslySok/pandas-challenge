# Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

## Background
A new repository for this project called pandas-challenge was created and was cloned to my computer.
Inside my local git repository, "HeroesOfPymoli" directory was created with the Jupyter notebook "HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb."
The "Resources" folder contains the CSV files "purchase_data" that was used.
